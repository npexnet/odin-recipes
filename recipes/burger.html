        <li>1/2 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>For Assembling the Burgers:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 burger buns</li>
        <li>4 cheese slices (cheddar, American, or your choice)</li>
        <li>4 lettuce leaves</li>
        <li>1 large tomato, sliced</li>
        <li>1 small onion, sliced</li>
        <li>Sliced pickles</li>
        <li>Ketchup to taste</li>
        <li>Mustard to taste</li>
        <li>Mayonnaise to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps to Prepare</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Patties:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine ground beef, salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and Worcestershire sauce (if using). Mix gently until just combined; do not overwork the meat.</li>
                <li>Divide the mixture into 4 equal portions and shape each portion into a patty about 3/4 inch thick. Make a slight indentation in the center of each patty with your thumb to prevent the burgers from puffing up during cooking.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Patties:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat a grill or a skillet over medium-high heat. If using a skillet, add a small amount of oil to prevent sticking.</li>
                <li>Cook the patties for about 3-4 minutes on each side for medium doneness. Adjust the cooking time for your preferred level of doneness.</li>
                <li>During the last minute of cooking, place a slice of cheese on each patty to melt. Cover the grill or skillet with a lid to help the cheese melt evenly.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Toast the Buns:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li>While the patties are cooking, lightly toast the burger buns on the grill or in a toaster.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Assemble the Burgers:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li>Spread mayonnaise on the bottom half of each toasted bun.</li>
                <li>Place a lettuce leaf on each bun, followed by a cooked patty with melted cheese.</li>
                <li>Add tomato slices, onion slices, and pickles on top of the patty.</li>
                <li>Spread ketchup and mustard on the top half of the bun.</li>
                <li>Place the top bun over the assembled ingredients.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li>Serve the burgers immediately with your favorite sides such as fries, coleslaw, or a salad.</li>
